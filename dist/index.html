				<h1>Myasthenia WHAT?!!!?</h1>
				<p>
					While prepping for a bodybuilding show in February of 2012, Philip Williams started	having spells of dizziness while working out. He was 6 weeks from a show and believed these spells were due to low body fat and carbohydrate cycling. He kept pushing through as his symptoms worsened, and eventually expanded to include double vision and muscle weakness.

					<h2>What it is</h2>
					<p>
						Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disorder that causes weakness in the skeletal muscles, which are the muscles your body uses for movement. It occurs when communication between nerve cells and muscles becomes impaired. This impairment prevents crucial muscle contractions from occurring, resulting in muscle weakness.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="does">
					<h2>What it does</h2>
					<p>
						The main symptom of MG is weakness in the voluntary skeletal muscles, which are muscles under your control. The failure of muscles to contract normally occurs because they canâ€™t respond to nerve impulses. Without proper transmission of the impulse, the communication between nerve and muscle is blocked and weakness results.

				<h1>How it Struck</h1>
				<p>
					After several doctors visits, and a misdiagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, his symptoms still became more dabilitating. Finally, in the Fall of 2012, he was diagnosed with <span class="MG">Myasthenia Gravis</span>. After 9 months of treatment his symptoms began to subside and his doctor told him that he could resume working out but his bodybuilding career is over. <span class="MG">Mission Accepted</span>

						<h2>Stop Bullying</h2>
							<p>
								Phil has taken his life to the next level, in every way, including Inspiration, where he has participated in the #stopbullyingnow campaign with friend and fellow bodybuilder Willie Raines a.k.a "Freight Train." #stopbullyingnow is a campaign that conducts school assemblies by using feats of strength to inspire elementary, middle and high school students to set challenging goals and act more courageously by minimizing the impact of negative social influences on their goals.

						<h2>Bodybuilding</h2>

And in spite of being told he would never compete again, Phil won multiple shows from 2014-2018, and finally earned his pro card and became an International Federation of Body Building and Fitness (IFBB) professional bodybuilder.
